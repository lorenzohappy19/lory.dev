            <h2>I made my own game engine!</h2>

            <p>Welcome back to lory.dev! Today I will write about my new game engine Lory3D, why I made it, and how you will be able to use it soon too!</p>
            <p>On today's blog post, I will go over what programming language I used, my IDE, what this engine can do and what it can't do!</p>
        </article>
        <article class="blog-post">
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>Good question.</p>
        </article>

            <h2>How I made Lory3D</h2>
            <p>Lory3D is built in Java using OpenGL. I'm using Eclipse as my IDE for this project, and following a bunch of Youtube tutorials.</p>
            <p>I will soon be publishing the source code for the engine, so you guys can take a look at my buggy code!</p>
            <p>This blog will also be used for devlogs, as I develop the engine more. As for now, there is no collision, and the lighting is not the best. I'm going for a 2010s aesthetic for this game, since that's all my GPU can run.</p>
            <p>As for if you wanna see screenshots, you're out of luck my friend. I'm still working on making some decent demo levels, since the current demo level is just an empty floor with no skybox.</p>

            <h2>What I'm going to be using it for</h2>
            <p>I'm thinking of doing some smaller projects, to showcase the engine a little bit. It's just another one of my side projects, and won't really be continued further after I finish the main mechanics. It's a very modular engine though, so you can add your own components easily.</p>

            <h2>When is it going to release?</h2>
            <p>I'm thinking of releasing it in a few months, but don't quote me on that. Maintaining a game is hard enough, let alone a buggy engine made by a 13-year-old.</p>

            <h2>Goodbye.</h2>
            <p>I will see you in the next blog post, hopefully not in 3 months. That's it for today, see you next time on lory.dev!</p>
