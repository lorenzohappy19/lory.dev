            <h2>Welcome to Lory.dev</h2>

            <p>Welcome to lory.dev! This is my new home, my new space, built from the ground up on HTML, CSS and JavaScript to inform you guys of news and new games that I'm working on.</p>
            <p>I've always wanted to make a website, but I've never gotten around to it. In this blog post, I'm gonna explain just how I did it, and how you can do it too!</p>

            <h2>The "history" of lory.dev and my previous domain, lorygames.it</h2>
            <p>A few months ago, I got the domain "lory.dev" for a bargain! It was around 10$/year, which is very low for a 4 character domain. It sat unused for a bit until I used it to make the currently defunct Lorycord.</p>
            <p>Lorycord was a Discord "private server", open in beta from the 29th of February to around the 5th of June. In the first two or three days, it was hosted on <strong>lorygames.it</strong>, which was a domain I got for my games, but never used it for much.</p>
            <p>It was also very buggy, and with very low-cost hosting. After a bit, I moved it to hostbrr, which Nadwey, one of my friends, suggested me.</p>
            <p>Point is, I'm very good at wasting money, but in this "tutorial" kinda post, I won't be doing that.</p>

            <h2>How I made lory.dev</h2>
            <p>I started off learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript earlier this year, but I didn't do much with them, and nothing was ever published.</p>
            <p>This website, however, is open source (as of writing this blog post)! You can check it out on my GitHub, make sure to also give it a star!</p>

                <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
                <strong>Please don't use my code as a "template". It has been written very poorly, and it's just not that great overall.</strong>

            <p>After writing the website, I uploaded it to GitHub, and used GitHub Pages to host it.</p>
            <p>In case you need any tutorials for those, some quick <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a> searches should hook you up with some.</p>
            <p>GitHub also has a "tutorial" for GitHub pages on <a href="https://pages.github.com">their website</a>.</p>

            <h2>Where I got lory.dev</h2>
            <p>In case you wanna get a domain yourself, I got mine on namecheap.com, with their privacy protection from whois. I'm also using Cloudflare, to protect my website against DDOS attacks, although I doubt GitHub pages will get DDOSed.</p>
            <p>I highly reccomend namecheap, they're a very good service, with fast domain registration and overall very reliable.</p>
